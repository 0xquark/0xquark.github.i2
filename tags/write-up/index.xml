      <description>Hi everyone, I rooted the box &amp;ldquo;Armageddon&amp;rdquo; from HackTheBox. This box include exploitation of drupal, duplicate credentials with bad password, and malicious installation of snap package to gain root access.
Foothold Let&amp;rsquo;s nmap the box :
$ nmap -A -p- -T4 10.10.10.233 Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-07-08 13:24 CEST Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.233 Host is up (0.064s latency). Not shown: 65533 closed ports PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 7.</description>

      <guid>https://itarow.github.io/posts/hackthebox-ophiuchi/</guid>
      <description>I rooted Ophiuchi which was a medium Linux machine. It implicates a flaw with YAML which allow to RCE. Apache tomcat credentials free, and a sudo capability to run a go file.
Foothold classic nmap :
➜ Ophiuchi nmap -A -p- -T4 10.10.10.227 PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.1 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) 8080/tcp open http Apache Tomcat 9.0.38 |_http-open-proxy: Proxy might be redirecting requests |_http-title: Parse YAML Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel So we are going to see the HTTP port.</description>

      <description>I rooted Spectra which was an Easy Other type machine. This box was cool, it implicates malicious plugin upload on WordPress, credentials find on “/etc/autologin/passwd” and sudo capabilities on “initctl”.
User So, classic nmap scan :
➜ Spectra nmap -A -p- -T4 10.10.10.229 Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-03-29 09:11 CEST Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.229 Host is up (0.073s latency). Not shown: 65532 closed ports PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.</description>

      <description>So I rooted Script-Kiddie from HackTheBox, which was an easy Linux box. This box was create by 0xdf, thanks to him. It includes a CVE on msfvenom for Foothold, a crontab exploit for the lateral movement and a sudo authorization on metasploit for root part.
Foothold First we start with a classic nmap scan :
$ nmap -A -p- -T4 10.10.10.226 PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.</description>
